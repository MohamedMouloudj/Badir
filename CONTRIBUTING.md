## Submitting a Pull Request
1. Ensure your branch is up to date with main.
2. Push your branch and open a Pull Request.
3. Fill out the PR template.
4. Include screenshots or videos if UI changes are made (optional).
5. Tag related issues, e.g. Closes #42.
6. Wait for review and address any feedback.

## Development notes
- All UI components live under components/ — follow existing patterns (AppButton, FormInput, etc.)
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for any new form.
- Use Supabase client from lib/supabase.ts for storage operations.
- Use Prisma via the services/ layer — don’t query DB directly from routes.
- Respect RLS (Row Level Security) when testing with Supabase.

## Security & responsible disclosure
If you find a security issue (e.g. auth bypass, data exposure):

- **Do not open a public issue**
- Email: badircontact@gmail.com (replace with your actual email)
- Provide steps to reproduce + environment info

We’ll acknowledge within 48 hours and coordinate a fix.

## Localization & accessibility
- Arabic (العربية) is the primary supported languages, and English is the secondary lamguage.
- Add new translations in `/data/i18n/` or `/language` (if you opt in `lingo.dev`. Check TODO.md).
- Follow RTL/LTR best practices when editing layout components.

## Code of Conduct
- Be respectful, collaborative, and inclusive.
- We build Badir for communities — let's embody that spirit when working together.
- Check `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## Thank you
Every contribution - big or small - makes a difference.
